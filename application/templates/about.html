    <h1>WHAT IS VEGG.AI?</h1>
    <br>
    <p class="p-about">VEGG.AI is an innovative application designed to revolutionize the way we recognize and classify vegetables through the power of artificial intelligence. 
        By simply uploading an image of a vegetable, users can quickly and accurately identify its type, leveraging the application's advanced image classification algorithms. 
        VEGG.AI stands out for its ability to accommodate two distinct image sizes: 128x128 pixels and 31x31 pixels, catering to different resolution needs without compromising on performance. 
        Impressively, the application achieves a remarkable 99% accuracy rate for images at 128x128 resolution and a 97% accuracy rate for the more challenging 31x31 resolution images. 
        This high level of accuracy underscores VEGG.AI's sophistication and reliability as a tool for users ranging from culinary enthusiasts and gardeners to professionals in the food and agricultural industries, offering them a quick, efficient, and highly accurate vegetable identification solution.</p>
